# Cherry Collection — Project by Hasini

This is a demo static website (HTML/CSS/JS) built for GitHub Pages.

## How to deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `project-by-hasini`).
2. Upload the files from this project (root should contain `index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, `images/`).
3. In the repository settings, under "Pages", set the source to the `main` branch (or `gh-pages`) and root folder.
4. Save — GitHub Pages will publish at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Notes
- Cart uses `localStorage` (client-side only).
- Contact form is a front-end demo (no backend).
